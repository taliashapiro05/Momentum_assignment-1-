    "This assignment builds practical skills in quantitative trading by implementing and evaluating momentum-based strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "- Implement and backtest **one** momentum strategy (core requirements)\n",
    "- Implement **two additional** momentum strategies (extension for advanced coders)\n",
    "- Build a **weighted composite momentum score** strategy (extension for advanced coders)\n",
    "- Present and discuss your project and results on the afternoon of 15 Feb 2026\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission requirements\n",
    "- A dedicated GitHub repository must be used to house and develop the project.\n",
    "- Invite the assessment team (howesrichard, samihossain25, and jasonyan-s) as collaborators on your project.\n",
    "- This notebook (`.ipynb`), with code and outputs, will form the central element of the project and should appear in the root folder of your repository.   You can have (and it is advised to make collaboration easier) functions and classes contained in separate python (.py) files in the repo which are imported into this notebook.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum trading is a strategy that seeks to profit from the continuation of existing market trends. The core idea is simple: assets that have performed well in the recent past tend, on average, to continue performing well in the near future, while assets that have performed poorly tend to continue underperforming. Unlike value or fundamental strategies, momentum trading relies almost entirely on **recent price behaviour**, rather than estimates of intrinsic value or long-term growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum effects are commonly attributed to behavioural factors such as **investor underreaction**, **herding**, and **slow diffusion of information**. When new information enters the market, prices may adjust gradually rather than instantaneously. As more investors observe a rising (or falling) price and react, the trend can become self-reinforcing. However, because momentum strategies depend on trends persisting, they are vulnerable to sharp reversals, making careful implementation and backtesting essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify momentum in a systematic way, traders use **technical indicators** derived from historical price data. In this assignment, we focus on three widely used momentum indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate of Change (ROC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Rate of Change (ROC)** is one of the simplest momentum indicators. It measures how much the price of an asset has changed over a fixed look-back period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, for a look-back window of ( n ) days, the ROC at time ( t ) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{ROC}_t = \\frac{P_t - P_{t-n}}{P_{t-n}} \\times 100$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $P_t$ is the price today\n",
    "* $P_{t-n}$ is the price ($n$) days ago\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive ROC indicates upward momentum (prices are higher than in the past), while a negative ROC indicates downward momentum. For example, an ROC of +5% over 10 days means the asset is trading 5% higher than it was 10 days ago. Because ROC is purely price-based, it reacts quickly to changes in trend but can also be noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving Average Crossover\n",
    "\n",
    "A **moving average (MA)** smooths price data by averaging prices over a rolling window. For a window of ( n ) days, the simple moving average (SMA) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{SMA}_t = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} P_{t-i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A **moving average crossover strategy** compares two moving averages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a **short-term** moving average (e.g. 20 days)\n",
    "* a **long-term** moving average (e.g. 50 or 100 days)\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum signals are generated based on their relative positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bullish signal (go long):** short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA\n",
    "* **Bearish signal (exit or short):** short-term MA crosses below the long-term MA\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that when recent prices rise faster than longer-term prices, a new upward trend may be forming. Moving average crossovers are slower to react than ROC but tend to produce smoother, more stable signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MACD** indicator measures momentum by comparing two **exponential moving averages (EMAs)**, which give more weight to recent prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, two EMAs are computed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **fast EMA** (commonly 12 days)\n",
    "* A **slow EMA** (commonly 26 days)\n",
    "\n",
    "The MACD line is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{MACD}_t = \\text{EMA}_{\\text{fast},t} - \\text{EMA}_{\\text{slow},t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a **signal line** is calculated as the EMA of the MACD line itself (typically over 9 days):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Signal}_t = \\text{EMA}_9(\\text{MACD}_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Trading signals are generated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bullish signal:** MACD crosses above the signal line\n",
    "* **Bearish signal:** MACD crosses below the signal line\n",
    "\n",
    "MACD captures both **trend direction** and **trend strength**, making it a popular choice for momentum strategies that aim to balance responsiveness with noise reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Multiple Indicators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each indicator captures momentum in a slightly different way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ROC reacts quickly but can be volatile\n",
    "* Moving averages provide smoother trend signals\n",
    "* MACD blends responsiveness with trend confirmation\n",
